Subject: Create a Football Player Card Component (eFootball/PES Style)

"Please build a React/Tailwind CSS component (or pure HTML/Tailwind) that replicates the football player card design from the attached image. Follow these specific requirements:

Card Structure: * The card should have a vertical rectangular shape with a 1:1.2 aspect ratio.

It needs a double border: an outer slightly different rarity color border and a slightly different rarity color inner frame.

Left Column (Info Section):

Rating: Large, bold white number at the top left (e.g., '88').

Position: Plain white text below the rating (e.g., 'LWF').

rarity Logo: A small circular or shield-shaped team logo placed at the bottom left of this column.

Background: This section should have a standard rarity color background.

Right Column (Visual Section):

Player Image: A centered, high-quality cutout of a player (transparent PNG) that sits on top of the circular graphics. can find at asset/faces folder.

Bottom Name Bar:

A solid pitch-black bar at the very bottom of the card.

The player's name should be centered in white, clean sans-serif font (e.g., 'ÉLBER').

Styling Details:

Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.

Ensure the card has a subtle 'drop-shadow' to make it look premium.

Make the component dynamic so I can easily change the name, rating, position, image, and logo via props/variables.
